## The 7-Stage Cognitive States:
1. Post-Hyperfocus Burnout: Intense exhaustion hidden from the subject; requires system-level interruption.
2. Negative Accumulation: Multiple emotional or analytical stressors leading to cognitive burnout and emotional dysregulation.
3. Impulsive Behavior: Rapid, instinctual decision-making.
4. Sensory Overload: High environmental stress indices.
5. Temporal Distortion: Mismatch between Hyperfocus/Flow and actual task demands, leading to poor time perception.
6. Hyper-Self-Monitoring: Excessive focus on self-evaluation and others' perspectives, inhibiting productivity.
7. Effective Recovery: Monitoring and verifying true neural reset states.
